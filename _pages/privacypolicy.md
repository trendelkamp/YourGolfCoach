# Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how **Golf in Leicht GmbH** (“we”, “our”, “us”) processes information inside the Your Golf Coach iOS and watchOS apps as well as on this website. Transparency, consent, and on-device processing are core parts of our product design.

## 1. Controller & Contact
- **Controller:** Golf in Leicht GmbH (Your Golf Coach), Bremen, Germany  
- **Support & data requests:** [app@fabianbuenker.de](mailto:app@fabianbuenker.de)  
- **Data deletion requests:** Send an email with the subject “Data Deletion Request” and include your Apple ID email plus any relevant details about stored rounds or sessions.

## 2. Scope of this policy
This policy covers the iOS, watchOS, and TestFlight builds of Your Golf Coach, the optional camera-based launch monitor, analytics/crash reporting, and this marketing website. If future companion services are added (e.g., a web academy), they will be covered by their own policies.

## 3. Data we process
### 3.1 Scorecards, rhythm sessions & preferences
- Saved locally on your device using Core Data / SwiftData.
- Optionally synced to your personal iCloud account via CloudKit so the same Apple ID sees the same data.
- Includes round metadata (course, holes, strokes, shot quality ratings), rhythm session speed, and display preferences.

### 3.2 Launch monitor footage
- Captured frames stay on-device inside the app cache (`Library/Caches/LaunchMonitorCache/`).
- Cached clips are automatically deleted on a FIFO basis (max. 500 MB or 30 days).
- Nothing is uploaded to our servers; processing runs on your device only.

### 3.3 Support contact & email
- When you email us, we receive your message, email address, and any files you attach.
- Stored in our email provider solely to respond to your inquiry.

### 3.4 Analytics (optional, opt-in)
- Provider: Google Firebase Analytics (Google Ireland Limited).
- Collected only after you toggle consent on in **Settings → Privacy**.
- Events: feature usage (e.g., rhythm session started), language selection, anonymous identifiers, device type, OS version, app version, consent status.
- Not collected: name, email, advertising identifiers (IDFA), precise GPS location.

### 3.5 Crash reporting (optional, opt-in)
- Provider: Firebase Crashlytics (Google Ireland Limited).
- Captures anonymized crash stacks, app version, and device model once you enable consent.
- Used solely to fix bugs and improve stability.

### 3.6 Website diagnostics
- This static website is hosted via GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect standard web server logs (IP address, browser type, etc.) for security and operation of the service. We do not link those logs to app data.

## 4. Why we process your data
- Provide golf training features, rhythm cues, and scorecard storage.
- Sync your data between iPhone and Watch via your iCloud account.
- Maintain security, troubleshoot crashes, and improve stability (with consent).
- Respond to support requests and fulfill legal obligations (e.g., accounting).
- Meet regulatory requirements (GDPR/CCPA) for transparency and user rights.

## 5. Technologies & processors
| Service | Purpose | Data location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple CloudKit & iCloud | Optional multi-device sync | Stored in the user’s personal iCloud containers managed by Apple (processor) |
| Firebase Analytics (opt-in) | Usage metrics | EU data centers operated by Google Ireland Limited |
| Firebase Crashlytics (opt-in) | Crash diagnostics | EU data centers operated by Google Ireland Limited |
| GitHub Pages | Hosting this marketing site | GitHub (USA) – subject to their privacy policy |

We do not sell information, and we do not share personal data with advertisers.

## 6. Legal bases
- **Performance of a contract:** Provide core app features you request.
- **Consent:** Analytics, crash reporting, and marketing communications.
- **Legitimate interest:** Safeguard the service, prevent abuse, and comply with platform requirements.
- **Legal obligation:** Respond to lawful requests or fulfill accounting/tax rules.

## 7. Retention
- On-device data stays until you delete it from the app or remove the app.
- iCloud data stays until you delete it from the app, revoke iCloud sync, or remove it via iCloud.com.
- Analytics and crash logs follow Firebase retention (currently 2–14 months, configurable).
- Support emails are purged once your request has been fulfilled or legal retention expires.

## 8. Your rights (GDPR/CCPA)
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
- Access, rectify, or delete your personal data.
- Restrict or object to certain processing.
- Withdraw analytics/crash consent at any time.
- Port the data you supplied (export scorecards via Apple’s iCloud export tools).
- Lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.

## 9. Exercising your rights & deleting data
1. Open **Settings → Privacy** inside the app to toggle analytics/crash consent.
2. Delete rounds or rhythm sessions directly inside the relevant tabs.
3. Remove the app to delete local data.  
4. Email [app@fabianbuenker.de](mailto:app@fabianbuenker.de) with the subject “Data Deletion Request” if you need us to delete residual support messages or confirm the removal of analytics data. Include the Apple ID email linked to your iCloud account so we can locate entries.

## 10. Children’s privacy
Your Golf Coach is intended for adult golfers and is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from your child, contact us so we can delete it.

## 11. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as the product evolves. Material changes will be highlighted in the app (Settings → Privacy) and on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the app after changes takes effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
