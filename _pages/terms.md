# Terms of Service
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the **Your Golf Coach** iOS + watchOS applications, any TestFlight builds, and this website. By accessing or using the app you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the services.

## 1. Provider
The app is provided by **Golf in Leicht GmbH**, operating as “Your Golf Coach”, based in Bremen, Germany. Contact us at [app@fabianbuenker.de](mailto:app@fabianbuenker.de).

## 2. Use of the App
- Use the app only for lawful purposes and in accordance with golf-course safety rules.  
- Do not attempt to reverse engineer, resell, or misuse the software, launch monitor, or network services.  
- You are responsible for the devices and network connection you use to access the service.

## 3. Subscriptions & Purchases
Future premium modules may be sold through Apple’s in-app purchases. All billing, free trials, renewals, and cancellations are handled by Apple and subject to App Store policies. Pricing can change, but we will display the final price before purchase.

## 4. Data & Privacy
Our processing of personal information is described in the [Privacy Policy](/privacypolicy). Analytics and crash reporting are optional and require your consent in-app. By using the service you also agree to the collection of technical diagnostics needed to operate and secure the platform.

## 5. Intellectual Property
All logos, trademarks, course content, and code remain the property of Golf in Leicht GmbH or its licensors. You receive a personal, non-transferable license to use the app for your own training purposes.

## 6. Disclaimers
The app is provided “as is” and “as available”. We do not warrant that training metrics or launch monitor readings will be error-free or that the service will be uninterrupted.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Golf in Leicht GmbH is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, or profit arising from your use of the service.

## 8. Changes to the Service
We may modify or discontinue features (including beta modules) at any time. Material changes will be announced via release notes or in-app messaging. Continued use after changes means you accept the modifications.

## 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or abuse the service. You can stop using the app at any time; deleting the app removes local data stored on your device.

## 10. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Mandatory consumer rights in your country of residence remain unaffected.

## 11. Contact
For support or questions about these Terms, email [app@fabianbuenker.de](mailto:app@fabianbuenker.de).
