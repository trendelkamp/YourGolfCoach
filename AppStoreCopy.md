## Full Description (App Store Connect “Description” Field)

Your Golf Coach is the all-in-one training companion from PGA coach Fabian Bünker. Groove tempo with synchronized iPhone + Apple Watch haptics, capture “expectationless” scorecards that focus on process, and leverage our camera-based launch monitor (beta) without buying extra hardware. Every feature is built for serious golfers who want pro-level insight and on-course calm.

### Highlights
- **Rhythm Trainer** – Customize a 1-2-3-4 cadence, switch between audio or haptic cues, and mirror the beat to Apple Watch for hands-free reps.
- **Expectationless Scorecard** – Log classic scores plus shot-quality sliders so you grade rhythm, impact, and focus instead of obsessing over bogeys.
- **Launch Monitor (Beta)** – Use your iPhone camera to estimate ball speed, launch angle, and carry distance—clips stay on-device with auto-delete.
- **Insights & Trends** – View strokes, putts, and quality metrics across your last 10 holes with spark lines and color-coded trends.
- **Offline First** – Enter rounds and run rhythm sessions without reception; CloudKit sync keeps data consistent once you’re back online.
- **Localization** – English + German translations, including legal copy, so you can practice in your preferred language.
